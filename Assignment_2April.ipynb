    "Q1. What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "--\n",
    "---\n",
    "GridSearchCV is a method used in machine learning for hyperparameter tuning. The goal is to find the optimal values for a given model's hyperparameters. The performance of a model can significantly depend on the value of hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV works by performing an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator. You pass predefined values for hyperparameters to the GridSearchCV function by defining a dictionary in which you mention a particular hyperparameter along with the values it can take. \n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV tries all the combinations of the values passed in the dictionary and evaluates the model for each combination using the Cross-Validation method. Hence, after using this function, you get accuracy/loss for every combination of hyperparameters, and you can choose the one with the best performance."

    "-GridSearchCV creates a grid over the search space and evaluates the model for all of the possible hyperparameters in the space. It tries all the combinations of your parameters. This method is simple and exhaustive, but it may be computationally expensive if the search space is large (e.g., very many hyperparameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "-RandomizedSearchCV uses a random set of hyperparameters. It selects a fixed number of parameter settings randomly from the specified distributions. This method can be useful when there are many hyperparameters, so the search space is large. It's good for optimizing fewer parameters, but in cases when you're unsure about multiple parameters, it may leave aside some combinations that would be better.\n",

    "The choice between GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV depends on your specific needs and resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "-If computational resources and time are not a concern, and you want to be sure to find the optimal hyperparameters, GridSearchCV might be a better choice because it is exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "-If you have a large number of hyperparameters and limited resources, or if you have a prior belief on what the hyperparameters should be, RandomizedSearchCV can be a more efficient choice because it allows you to control the number of parameter settings that are tried."

    "--\n",
    "---\n",
    "Data leakage, also known as target leakage, in machine learning occurs when the training data contains information about the target, but similar data won't be available when the model is used for prediction. This can lead to high performance on the training dataset (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage is a problem because it can cause you to create overly optimistic if not completely invalid predictive models. This additional information can allow the model to learn or know something that it otherwise would not know and in turn invalidate the estimated performance of the model being constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you're trying to predict whether a patient will get sick based on their medical history and lifestyle habits. If your training data includes information about whether the patient got sick after the data was collected (e.g., a future doctor's visit), this would be data leakage. The model might perform well on the training data because it has access to this future information. However, when you use the model to make predictions in real-time, you won't have information about future doctor's visits, so the model's performance will likely be much worse."
